a dead simple in-game speedrun timer for minecraft using fabric

although there are few mods permitted for use with minecraft speedrunning (under [speedrun.com](https://www.speedrun.com/mc) rules), i wanted to create something within the limits of what's already allowed, i.e. just fabric loader. if you care about submitting runs, there are several other external programs for timing IGT which are allowed.

---

features:
- IGT overlay
- stops after dragon is defeated

~~things i might do later~~ todo:
- config (text color, positioning, etc)
- RTA timer
- hotkeys, such as enable/disable overlay, start stop and reset for RTA timer

known issues:
- when loading a world where the dragon has already been defeated, the timer will pause on the IGT when the world was loaded instead of when the dragon was defeated

i also haven't tested this on multiplayer servers at all
